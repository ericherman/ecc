"egregiously cheesy compiler"

A for-fun project to provide a place for exploring
 * x86 assembly
 * how to translate some C ideas to machine code
 * modularization and polymorphism in straight C
 * low-level C unit testing

Please do not confuse this with something intended to be useful
for anything other than fun or exploration.
